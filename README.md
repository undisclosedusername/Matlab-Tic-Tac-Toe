# Matlab-Tic-Tac-Toe
I need help changing this code from C++ into code that can run in Matlab. It needs to do the same exact thing. It is a tic tac toe game that initiallty draws up a blank board,
and then prompts the user to input a number from 1-9. Depending on the number, it will mark an X in that corresponsing box on the tic tac toe board. After that, the code will
automatically place an O in a random box that is not already taken. This is totally random. I have code that is just not working, and I will link it as well. Please help!
